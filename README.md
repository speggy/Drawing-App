# CEG4410 Homework 1 - Drawing App
This project was created as a simple application that allowed the user to use their mobile device as a drawing pad. It was implemented in Java using Android Studio to create different activities that met the requirements of the assignment. The user should be able to type a desired color into a text field and also press a button to get a randomly generated color. Additionally, the user can draw, change brush color, clear, and save their work. 

## Special Deployment Instructions
Ensure that the DrawView library from ByoxCode is installed: https://github.com/ByoxCode/DrawView.git

## How to Use
<ul>
  <li> User is presented with the main screen that has a text field and two buttons. The text field is used to demonstrate the color randomizer and allows the user to type whatever they like. The first button allows the user to randomize the color of the text in the field. The second button takes the user the the drawing canvas. </li>
  <li>This activity has the drawing canvas and 3 buttons. The drawing canvas allows the user to use their finger to draw. The 3 buttons allow color changing, clearing the screen, and the option to go back to the main activity. </li>
  <li>After the user has pressed the change color button, they are taken to a third acitivity to use sliders to select a custom color. Once they are satisfied with the color that is shown, pressing the back button takes them back to the canvas to use their new color. </li>
</ul>
